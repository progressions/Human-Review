    %p.terms Yahoo! researchers and scientists are instrumental in creating and continually improving Yahoo!’s cutting edge products and services that 100s of millions of people use every day around the world. To be able to do that better, we need your help. Select employees and trusted partners working on Y!'s behalf need to review a small percentage of emails and IMs to research topics like the subjects that are important to users, how users communicate with each other, and how to better personalize products, content, and advertising.
    
    %p.terms You and your emails and IMs can play a critical role in helping us improve Yahoo! products and services. Simply click on the “I Agree” button below to contribute all emails and IMs you send, receive, and store to this research project. Your contribution to Yahoo! research is greatly appreciated.
